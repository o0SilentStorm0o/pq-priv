# Protocol Specifications

This directory will host human-readable specifications that accompany the PQ-PRIV whitepaper and implementation blueprint. Drafts should cover transaction formats, consensus constants, proof system interfaces, and upgrade processes so that contributors have a canonical reference while implementing the workspace crates.

## Getting Started

* Start with the existing implementation blueprint in the repository root for the overall roadmap.
* Add focused RFC-style documents here as features stabilize (e.g., transaction serialization, STARK circuit interfaces, wallet audit flows).
* Keep each document versioned and include open questions plus acceptance criteria so downstream teams can plan audits.

> **Note:** Until the individual specs are filled in, treat this directory as the staging area for protocol documentation contributions.
