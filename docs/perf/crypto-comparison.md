**Project**: pq-priv blockchain  
**Date**: 24. Å™Ã­jna 2025  
**Branch**: feat/sprint8-privacy-phase1

## Overview

This document compares the performance characteristics of two critical cryptographic operations in the pq-priv blockchain:

1. **Post-Quantum Signatures (Dilithium2/ML-DSA-44)** - Transaction authentication
2. **Range Proofs (Bulletproofs+)** - Confidential transaction amounts

Both operations support **batch verification** for improved throughput.

## Key Findings

### 1. Range Proofs are Slower (but Acceptable)

**Single Operation:**
- Range proofs take **1.5-1.6x longer** than signatures
- This is expected: range proofs perform more complex mathematical operations
- Still **fast enough for production**: 2.44 ms verification is acceptable

**Why it's OK:**
- Signatures are verified on **every input** (1-3 per transaction)
- Range proofs are verified on **every output** (1-3 per transaction)  
- Both are similar scale, so relative cost is manageable

### 2. Parallel Performance is Comparable

**Batch Verification (100 items):**
- Both achieve **~30ms** for 100 items in parallel
- Both reach **~3,200-3,300 items/sec** throughput
- **Equal performance in real-world blockchain usage** âœ…

**Why this matters:**
- Blockchain nodes process batches (blocks) not individual items
- Parallel batch performance determines actual TPS
- Range proofs **match signature performance** at scale

### 3. Range Proofs Have Better Parallelization

**Speedup Comparison:**
- Signatures: 5x speedup (150ms â†’ 30ms)
- Range proofs: **7.9x speedup** (245ms â†’ 31ms)

**Analysis:**
- Range proof verification parallelizes **better** than signature verification
- Likely due to independent Bulletproofs operations vs shared PQ crypto state
- This compensates for slower single-operation performance

### 4. Range Proofs are Much Smaller

**Size Comparison:**
- Signature: ~2,400 bytes (Dilithium2)
- Range proof: **~675 bytes** (Bulletproofs+)
- Savings: **3.6x smaller** ðŸŽ‰

**Impact:**
- Lower bandwidth requirements
- Smaller block sizes for confidential transactions
- Better storage efficiency
- Faster network propagation

## Combined Transaction Cost

### Standard Transaction (2 inputs, 2 outputs)

**Without Privacy:**
- 2 signature verifications: 2 Ã— 1.5 ms = **3 ms**
- Range proofs: 0
- **Total: 3 ms**

**With Privacy (Confidential Amounts):**
- 2 signature verifications: 2 Ã— 1.5 ms = 3 ms
- 2 range proof verifications: 2 Ã— 2.44 ms = 4.88 ms
- **Total: 7.88 ms** (2.6x slower)

**Batch Processing (100 transactions, parallel):**
- 200 signature verifications: 30 ms (parallel)
- 200 range proof verifications: 31 ms (parallel)
- **Total: ~61 ms** (can overlap further with pipelining)
- **Throughput: ~1,640 TPS** with full privacy âœ…

## Blockchain Throughput Analysis

### Block Verification Time (100 transactions)

| Configuration | Sequential | Parallel | TPS (parallel) |
|--------------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| **Public TX (sigs only)** | 150 ms | 30 ms | 3,333 TPS |
| **Confidential TX (sigs + proofs)** | 395 ms | ~61 ms | **1,640 TPS** |

**Privacy Cost:**
- **2x slower** in parallel mode (30ms â†’ 61ms)
- Still **faster than Bitcoin** (~7 TPS) and **Ethereum** (~15-30 TPS)
- **Acceptable trade-off** for full amount confidentiality

## Proof Size Impact on Block Size

### Block with 100 Confidential Transactions

**Signature Data:**
- 200 signatures (2 per TX): 200 Ã— 2.4 KB = **480 KB**

**Range Proof Data:**
- 200 range proofs (2 per TX): 200 Ã— 0.675 KB = **135 KB**

**Total Crypto Data:**
- 615 KB for 100 transactions
- Average: **6.15 KB per transaction**

**Comparison:**
- Bitcoin TX: ~250 bytes (no privacy)
- Monero TX: ~2 KB (privacy with RingCT)
- **pq-priv TX: ~6.15 KB** (privacy + post-quantum security)

**Analysis:**
- 3x larger than Monero (due to PQ signatures)
- **Much smaller range proofs help** (675 bytes vs 2KB+ alternatives)
- Reasonable size for privacy + quantum resistance
