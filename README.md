# PQ-PRIV

**PQ-PRIV (Post-Quantum Privacy Layer-1)** is a research blockchain designed from day one to combine:

- üß© **Post-quantum cryptography** (CRYSTALS-Dilithium + STARK proofs)  
- üïµÔ∏è **Strong privacy by default** (stealth addresses, confidential amounts)  
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Compliance-ready UX** (selective disclosure, exchange subaddresses)  
- üß† **Built in Rust**, hybrid PoW/PoS consensus, and future-proof crypto-agility.
