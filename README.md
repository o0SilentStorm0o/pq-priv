# PQ-PRIV

**PQ-PRIV (Post-Quantum Privacy Layer-1)** is a research blockchain designed from day one to combine:

- 🧩 **Post-quantum cryptography** (CRYSTALS-Dilithium + STARK proofs)
- 🕵️ **Strong privacy by default** (stealth addresses, confidential amounts)
- ⚖️ **Compliance-ready UX** (selective disclosure, exchange subaddresses)
- 🧠 **Built in Rust**, hybrid PoW/PoS consensus, and future-proof crypto-agility.

## Privacy Features (Phase 1)

**Sprint 8** introduces **confidential transactions** using Pedersen commitments and Bulletproofs:

- 🔒 **Amount Confidentiality** – Transaction values hidden with cryptographic commitments
- 🛡️ **Inflation Protection** – Zero-knowledge range proofs prevent value creation
- ⚖️ **DoS Resistance** – Proof size limits (32KB) and per-block caps (1000 proofs)
- 📊 **Privacy Metrics** – Prometheus monitoring for verification performance
- 🧪 **Comprehensive Testing** – 39 unit/integration tests + 4 fuzz targets

**Key Components:**

| Component | Description | Performance |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Pedersen Commitments** | Hide values with homomorphic cryptography | ~48 µs per commitment |
| **Bulletproofs** | Zero-knowledge range proofs (64-bit) | ~24ms generation, ~15ms verification |
| **Balance Verification** | Prevent inflation via commitment equality | O(n) for n commitments |
| **Range Proofs** | Prove value in [0, 2^64-1] without revealing it | ~672 bytes per proof |

**Usage Example:**
```rust
use crypto::{commit_value, prove_range, verify_range};

// Create confidential output
let value = 100_000u64;
let blinding = random_32_bytes();
let commitment = commit_value(value, &blinding);
let proof = prove_range(value, &blinding)?;

// Verify (consensus layer)
verify_range(&commitment, &proof)?; // ~15ms
```

**Security Guarantees:**
- ✅ **128-bit security** against discrete logarithm attacks
- ✅ **Soundness**: < 2^-128 probability of forging valid proof
- ✅ **Zero-knowledge**: Verifier learns nothing except value is in range
- ⚠️ **Not quantum-resistant** (requires lattice-based commitments in Phase 2)

**Testing Coverage:**
- 22 crypto unit tests (commitments, proofs, balance, security)
- 9 TX integration tests (output creation, serialization, full flow)
- 8 consensus tests (validation, rejection, DoS protection)
- 4 fuzz targets (25+ strategies for robustness testing)

## Node architecture highlights

PQ-PRIV's full node couples persistent state, fork choice, and the sync pipeline to
match the Sprint 3 acceptance criteria:

- **RocksDB persistence** – Blocks, headers, UTXOs, and link tags are stored in
  dedicated column families with typed key prefixes. Tip metadata, compact UTXO
  indices, and snapshot checkpoints live in the meta column family. See
  [`spec/storage.md`](./spec/storage.md) for an exhaustive layout reference.
- **Deterministic fork choice** – Chainstate tracks an in-memory block index with
  cumulative work accounting, reorg detection, and broadcast tip updates. The
  reorg path unwinds/rewinds UTXO state, persists the new tip, snapshots when
  configured, and keeps the mempool consistent. Details are captured in
  [`spec/fork-choice.md`](./spec/fork-choice.md).
- **Sync pipeline** – The runtime launches dedicated tasks for peer events,
  chain notifications, and locator broadcasting. `SyncManager` consumes network
  inventories to drive header registration and block downloads while updating
  peer best heights. The end-to-end flow is documented in
  [`spec/fork-choice.md`](./spec/fork-choice.md) and [`spec/metrics.md`](./spec/metrics.md).
- **Prometheus metrics** – `/metrics` exposes chain height, cumulative work,
  mempool depth, reorg counters, and RocksDB compaction gauges for monitoring.

> ⚠️ **Security Warning**: The `/metrics` endpoint is **NOT intended for public internet exposure**.
> It should be bound to `localhost` (default: `127.0.0.1:8645`) or protected with authentication
> (mTLS, reverse proxy with basic auth). Database size and performance metrics can leak information
> about blockchain activity and system capacity. See [`docs/perf/storage.md`](./docs/perf/storage.md#metrics-security)
> for configuration examples.

## Development

```bash
# Install the pinned toolchain
rustup toolchain install 1.90.0
rustup component add rustfmt clippy

# Run the standard quality gates
make fmt
make lint
make test
make audit
```

* All builds and tests run with `--locked` (Makefile sets this by default)
* Lints and tests run automatically in GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
* For a quick local testnet, run the PowerShell script (Windows) or bash script (Linux/macOS)

### Local Testnet (Windows)

```powershell
# PowerShell 7+ required
.\scripts\testnet-up.ps1
```

The script:
- Builds the node with `devnet` feature (enables `/dev/mine` endpoint)
- Generates configuration in `.testnet/node.toml`
- Starts the node with automatic port allocation
- Runs 12 comprehensive integration tests:
  - Health checks, genesis verification, mining (6 blocks)
  - Metrics validation, snapshot creation, restart persistence
  - Database integrity, error handling
- Cleans up: stops node, removes test database

### Docker Multi-Node Testnet

```bash
make docker-build
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up
```

This starts:
- **node_a**: RPC on `:8645`, P2P on `:8644`
- **node_b**: RPC on `:8745`, P2P on `:8744`
- Health checks every 15 seconds
- Persistent volumes for blockchain data and snapshots

Test the nodes:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8645/health      # node_a
curl http://localhost:8745/health      # node_b
curl http://localhost:8645/chain/tip   # genesis block
```

## E2E Multi-Node Testing

Comprehensive Docker-based test suite for validating P2P networking and consensus:

```bash
# Test linear topology (A → B → C sync)
./scripts/e2e-test.ps1 -topology line -ports 8545,8546,8547 -minHeight 101

# Test star topology (hub + 3 leafs)
./scripts/e2e-test.ps1 -topology star -ports 8550,8551,8552,8553 -minHeight 100

# Test partition + reorg (competing chains)
./scripts/e2e-test.ps1 -topology partition -ports 8560,8561,8562 -minHeight 250
```

**Validated Scenarios:**
- ✅ 10-node concurrent mining and sync
- ✅ Network partition with successful reorg (250-block chains)
- ✅ Fork-choice algorithm selecting longest chain
- ✅ Zero event lag under burst conditions

## Network Scalability

**Current Capacity (MVP/Testnet):**
- Tested: 10 concurrent nodes, 250-block burst syncs
- Safe capacity: ~100 concurrent peers
- Event buffer: 2048 messages (sufficient for testnet scale)

**Roadmap to Mainnet (1000+ peers):**
- Phase 2 (6mo): Public testnet with monitoring
- Phase 3 (12mo): Optimize based on metrics (deduplication, segmented channels)
- Phase 4 (24mo): Actor-based architecture for production scale
