# PQ-PRIV

**PQ-PRIV (Post-Quantum Privacy Layer-1)** is a research blockchain designed from day one to combine:

- üß© **Post-quantum cryptography** (CRYSTALS-Dilithium + STARK proofs)
- üïµÔ∏è **Strong privacy by default** (stealth addresses, confidential amounts)
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Compliance-ready UX** (selective disclosure, exchange subaddresses)
- üß† **Built in Rust**, hybrid PoW/PoS consensus, and future-proof crypto-agility.

## Node architecture highlights

PQ-PRIV's full node couples persistent state, fork choice, and the sync pipeline to
match the Sprint¬†3 acceptance criteria:

- **RocksDB persistence** ‚Äì Blocks, headers, UTXOs, and link tags are stored in
  dedicated column families with typed key prefixes. Tip metadata, compact UTXO
  indices, and snapshot checkpoints live in the meta column family. See
  [`spec/storage.md`](./spec/storage.md) for an exhaustive layout reference.
- **Deterministic fork choice** ‚Äì Chainstate tracks an in-memory block index with
  cumulative work accounting, reorg detection, and broadcast tip updates. The
  reorg path unwinds/rewinds UTXO state, persists the new tip, snapshots when
  configured, and keeps the mempool consistent. Details are captured in
  [`spec/fork-choice.md`](./spec/fork-choice.md).
- **Sync pipeline** ‚Äì The runtime launches dedicated tasks for peer events,
  chain notifications, and locator broadcasting. `SyncManager` consumes network
  inventories to drive header registration and block downloads while updating
  peer best heights. The end-to-end flow is documented in
  [`spec/fork-choice.md`](./spec/fork-choice.md) and [`spec/metrics.md`](./spec/metrics.md).
- **Prometheus metrics** ‚Äì `/metrics` exposes chain height, cumulative work,
  mempool depth, reorg counters, and RocksDB compaction gauges for monitoring.

## Development

```bash
# Install the pinned toolchain
rustup toolchain install 1.90.0
rustup component add rustfmt clippy

# Run the standard quality gates
make fmt
make lint
make test
make audit
```

* V≈°echny buildy a testy spou≈°tƒõjte s `--locked` (Makefile to ji≈æ nastavuje).
* Linty a testy bƒõ≈æ√≠ automaticky v GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
* Pro rychl√Ω lok√°ln√≠ testnet spus≈•te `make testnet-up` (ukonƒçen√≠ `make testnet-down`).

```bash
BLOCKS=256 make testnet-up
tail -f .testnet/node.log
```

## Docker image

```bash
make docker-build
docker run --rm pqpriv:dev --help
```

For a two-node sandbox with persistent volumes and health-checked RPC services:

```bash
make docker-build
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up
```
